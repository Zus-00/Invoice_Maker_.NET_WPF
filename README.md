# InvoiceMaker(.NET_WPF)

## Overview
A Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application developed to streamline invoice generation and management. It showcases implementation in object-oriented programming (OOP), advanced C# techniques, and modern UI design.

The application offers dynamic features like importing invoice data from files, calculating totals with taxes, and providing a user-friendly interface for real-time updates.

## Features
- **File Import**: Load invoice data from structured `.txt` files.
- **Customizable Fields**: Edit dates, discount rates, and other details directly through the UI.
- **Dynamic Calculations**:
  - Total amount including tax for each item.
  - Separate breakdown of taxes.
- **Optional Features**:
  - Add company logos.
  - Print or save invoices as images.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: C#
- **Framework**: .NET Framework 4.x/5+ with WPF.
- **Programming Paradigm**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Event-Driven Architecture.
- **Design Principles**:
  - Tuple usage for grouped data management.
  - Record types for lightweight data storage.
  - Optional MVVM implementation for scalable architecture.

## How It Works
1. Import an invoice file using the `File > Import` menu option.
2. Modify details (e.g., dates, discounts) using the user-friendly interface.
3. Review calculated totals and tax breakdowns in real-time.
4. (Optional) Print or save the invoice for distribution.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Advanced **C# Programming** and **.NET Framework** capabilities.
- Expertise in **WPF** for crafting responsive and professional UIs.
- Effective use of **Tuples**, **Records**, and **LINQ**.
- Strong understanding of **OOP principles** applied to real-world scenarios.
